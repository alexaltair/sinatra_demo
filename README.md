sinatra_demo
============

Simple Sinatra app demos working with the OMDB API.

This app was created by Alex Altair during the General Assembly June WDI course in San Francisco. The goal of this project was to learn how to use Ruby with Sinatra to create a real, working web app. The second stage was taking the basic HTML we had created and practicing CSS by making it beautiful.
